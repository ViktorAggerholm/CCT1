### Bits & Data Types
### Definitions
Boolean algebra may be defined with a sef of elemens, operators and a number of axioms and postulates.
A *set* of elements is any collection of objects, usually having a common property.

The postulates of a mathematical system form the basic assumptions, from which the rules, theorems, properties and axioms are deduced.
There 6 common postulates that formulate various algebaric structures, including boolean algebra:
1. **Closure**.
A set *S* is said to be *closed* or have *closure* with respect to the binary operator if, for every pair of elements of *S*, the binary *operator* specifies a rule for obtaining a unique element of *S*.
	The set of natural numbers *N* is closed with respect to the binary operator '+' by the rules of arithmetic addition, since *a* + *b* withing *N*, there's a unique *c*, such that *a* + *b* = *c*.
	N is **not** closed with respect to the '-' operator, since *a* - *b* can equal a negative integer, and negative integers are not part of the natural numbers
	2 - 3 = -1, -1 is **NOT** part of *N*.

2. **Associative**
A binary operator '*ø*' on the set *S*, is said to be *associative* whenever
```
(x ø y) ø z = x ø (y ø z)
```
for all *x*, *y*, *z* within *S*

3. **Commutative**
A binary operator '*ø*' on the set *S*, is said to be *commutative* whenever
```
x ø y = y ø x
```
for all *x*, *y*, *z* within *S*

4. Identity 
An element *e* within the set *S* is said to be the *identity element* with respect to the binary operatoin '*ø*' if *e* has the follwing property
```
e ø x = x ø e = x
```
for every *x* within *S*
	The element *e* = 0, is an *identity element* with the respect to the binary operator '+', on the set of integers {..., -1, 0, 1, ...}. since
```
x + 0 = 0 + x = x
```
for any *x*.
	The element *e* = 1, is an *identity element* with respect to the binary operator 'x' (times/multiplication), on the set of integers {..., -1, 0, 1, ...}. since
```
y x 1 = 1 x y = y
```
for any *y*.

5. **Inverse**
A set *S*, having the identity element *e* with respect to the binary operator *ø*, is said to have an *inverse* whenever, for every *x* within *S*, there exsists an element *y* within *S* such that
```
x ø y = e
```
In the integer-set *I*, with the operator '+', with the indentity element *e* = 0, the inverse of an element *a* is -*a*, since 
```
a + (-a) = 0
```
6. **Distributive**
If *ø* and *æ* are two binary operators on the set *S*, *ø* is said to be distributive over *æ* whenever
```
x ø (y æ z) = (x ø y) æ (x ø z)
```

### LOGIC - AND, OR, NOT
The "logic" behind logic gates such as the AND-, OR- or NOT-gate is based upon the *two-valued* Boolean algebraic system, also called *switching algebra*.

#### Two-Valued Boolean Algebra
A *two-valued* Boolean algebra is defined on a set *B* of two elements *B* = {0, 1}, mirroring the binary number system/set, with rules for two binary operators '*+*' and '*ø*.

##### AND-Gate
![[Pasted image 20250917181120.png]]
The AND logic gate uses the previously defined '*ø*' operator, to create a *0-prioritized* output.
Drawing parallel to the decimal system, the '*ø*'-operator could be seen as a multiplication-style operator, where all inputs have to =1 in order for the output to =1.
```
0 x 0 = 0
0 x 1 = 0
1 x 0 = 0
1 x 1 = 1
```

##### OR-Gate
![[Pasted image 20250917181615.png]]
The OR logic gate uses '*+*' operator, to create a *1-prioritized* output.
Drawing parallel to the decimal system, the '*+*'-operator could be seen as an addition-style operrator, where any singular input has to =1 in order for the output to =1.
```
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 1
```

##### NOT-Gate
![[Pasted image 20250917185212.png]]
The NOT logic gate doesn't use an operator, but acts as an inverter, giving the **opposite** output to its input.
If a parallel can even be drawn to decimal, it would be to multiply the input by -1, to invert the sign of the input; though this isn't a complete analogy.
```
1 x -1 = 0
0 x -1 = 1
```
