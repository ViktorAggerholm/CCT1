# 3.1 Introduction
*Gate-level minimization* is the design task of finding the optimal gate-level implementation for a Boolean function(s), describing a digital circuit.
# 3.2 The Map Method
The complexity of the digital logic gates that implement a Boolean function is directly related to the complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.
The map method presented here provides a simple, straightforward procedure for minimizing Boolean functions. This method may be regarded as a pictorial form of a truth table. The map method is also known as the *Karnaugh map* or *K-map*.

A K-map is a diagram made of squares, each square represents a minterm of the function to be minimized.
	Since Boolean functions can be expressed as a sum of minterms; the same functions can be recognized graphically in the K-map.
	The simplified expressions are always in one of the two standard forms.

## Two-Variable K-Map
IN a two-variable map there're four minterms; 4 squares.
- If we mark the squares whose midterms belong to a given function, the 2-variable map becomes another way to represent any one of the 16 Boolean functions of two variables.

Since *xy* = *m3*, a 1 is placed inside the square belonging to *m3*.

The function of *x + y* is represented by three squares marked with 1's. These squares form the minterms of the function:

## Three-Variable K-Map
In a 3-variable K-map, there're 8 minterms for 3 binary variables.
	Note that the minterms are arranged in sequence similar to grey code.
	The characteristic of this sequence is that **only one bit changes in value from one adjacent collum ot the next**
	Meaning that the binary sequence `00 01 10 11` would become `00 01 11 10`; with only one digit changing per collum.

	Any two adjacent squares in the map, differ only by one variable. 
	Which is primed in one square and unprimed in the other.

## Five-Variable Map
Maps for more than four variables, are not as simple to use as those for four or less.
A five-variable K-map needs 32 squares, a six-variable 64 squares...
# 3.5 (3.4?) Product-of-sums Simplification
The minimized Boolean functions derived can, with a minor modification, obtain the product-of-sum form of a function.
The procedure for minimizing the function in product-of-sums follows from basic properties of Boolean functions.
- The 1's are placed in the squares that represent the minterms of the function.
	The minterms not included in the standard sum-of-products of a functions, denote the complement of the function.
	This means the function's complement is the squares *not* marked by 1's.
If we mark empty squares *0* and combine them winto valid adjacent squares, we obtain a simplified sum-of-products expression of the complement to the function (*F'*).
The complement to *F'* (*F*) gives us the function in product-of-sums, as a consequence of DeMorgan's theorem.
