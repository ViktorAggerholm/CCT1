## Boolean Algebra Fundamentals

Boolean algebra is a mathematical system defined with a set of elements, operators, and a number of axioms and postulates. It forms the foundation of digital logic and computer science.

A _set_ of elements is any collection of objects, usually having a common property.

_Figure 1.1: Representation of a set of elements_

The postulates of a mathematical system form the basic assumptions, from which the rules, theorems, properties and axioms are deduced. There are 6 common postulates that formulate various algebraic structures, including boolean algebra:

### 1. Closure

A set _S_ is said to be _closed_ or have _closure_ with respect to the binary operator if, for every pair of elements of _S_, the binary _operator_ specifies a rule for obtaining a unique element of _S_.

The set of natural numbers _N_ is closed with respect to the binary operator '+' by the rules of arithmetic addition, since $a + b$ withing _N_, there's a unique _c_, such that $a + b = c$.

N is **not** closed with respect to the '-' operator, since $a - b$ can equal a negative integer, and negative integers are not part of the natural numbers: $2 - 3 = -1$, $-1$ is **NOT** part of _N_.

_Figure 1.2: Illustrating the concept of closure, showing that operations within a set produce results that remain in the set._

### 2. Associative Property

A binary operator '$\cdot$' on the set _S_, is said to be _associative_ whenever
$$(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$$
for all _x_, _y_, _z_ within _S_.

![[Pasted image 20250917173830.png]]

_Figure 1.3: Showing the associative property of operations._

### 3. Commutative Property

A binary operator '$\cdot$' on the set _S_, is said to be _commutative_ whenever
$$x \cdot y = y \cdot x$$
for all _x_, _y_ within _S_.

![[Pasted image 20250917173841.png]]

_Figure 1.4: Illustrating the commutative property of operations._

### 4. Identity Element

An element _e_ within the set _S_ is said to be the _identity element_ with respect to the binary operation '$\cdot$' if _e_ has the following property:
$$e \cdot x = x \cdot e = x$$
for every _x_ within _S_.

The element _e_ = 0, is an _identity element_ with respect to the binary operator '+', on the set of integers {..., -1, 0, 1, ...}, since:
$$x + 0 = 0 + x = x$$
for any _x_.

The element _e_ = 1, is an _identity element_ with respect to the binary operator '×' (times/multiplication), on the set of integers {$..., -1, 0, 1, ...$}, since:
$$y \times 1 = 1 \times y = y$$
for any _y_.

![[Pasted image 20250917180153.png]]

_Figure 1.5: Illustrating the identity element property._

### 5. Inverse Element

A set _S_, having the identity element _e_ with respect to the binary operator $\cdot$, is said to have an _inverse_ whenever, for every _x_ within _S_, there exists an element _y_ within _S_ such that:
$$x \cdot y = e$$

In the integer-set _I_, with the operator '+', with the identity element _e_ = 0, the inverse of an element _a_ is -_a_, since:
$$a + (-a) = 0$$

### 6. Distributive Property

If $\cdot$ and $+$ are two binary operators on the set _S_, $\cdot$ is said to be distributive over $+$ whenever:
$$x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)$$

![[Pasted image 20250917180207.png]]

_Figure 1.6: Illustrating the distributive property of operations._

| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Closure**      | An operation on a set always produces a unique element that is also in the set.        | `2 + 3 = 5` (in Natural Numbers)                 | `0 + 1 = 1` (in Boolean set {0,1})                                               |
| **Associative**  | The grouping of operations does not affect the result: `(x · y) · z = x · (y · z)`     | `(2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4)`                      | `(A AND B) AND C = A AND (B AND C)`                                              |
| **Commutative**  | The order of operands does not affect the result: `x · y = y · x`                      | `2 + 3 = 3 + 2`                                  | `A OR B = B OR A`                                                                |
| **Identity**     | An element `e` exists that leaves other elements unchanged: `e · x = x`                | `5 + 0 = 5` (0 is the additive identity)         | `A OR 0 = A` (0 is OR identity) <br> `A AND 1 = A` (1 is AND identity)           |
| **Inverse**      | For every element `x`, there is an element `y` that produces the identity: `x · y = e` | `5 + (-5) = 0` (-5 is the additive inverse of 5) | `A OR A' = 1` (A' is the OR inverse) <br> `A AND A' = 0` (A' is the AND inverse) |
| **Distributive** | One operator distributes over another: `x · (y + z) = (x · y) + (x · z)`               | `2 * (3 + 4) = (2 * 3) + (2 * 4)`                | `A AND (B OR C) = (A AND B) OR (A AND C)`                                        |

## Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra

The "logic" behind logic gates such as the AND-, OR- or NOT-gate is based upon the _two-valued_ Boolean algebraic system, also called _switching algebra_.

![[Pasted image 20250917180643.png]]

### Two-Valued Boolean Algebra

A _two-valued_ Boolean algebra is defined on a set _B_ of two elements _B_ = {0, 1}, mirroring the binary number system/set, with rules for two binary operators '+' (OR) and '$\cdot$' (AND).

![[Pasted image 20250917181010.png]]

_Figure 2.4: A table showing the two-element set of Boolean algebra._

### Logic Gates

#### AND-Gate

The AND logic gate uses the previously defined '$\cdot$' operator, to create a _0-prioritized_ output.

Drawing parallel to the decimal system, the '$\cdot$'-operator could be seen as a multiplication-style operator, where all inputs have to =1 in order for the output to =1.
$$0 \cdot 0 = 0$$
$$0 \cdot 1 = 0$$
$$1 \cdot 0 = 0$$
$$1 \cdot 1 = 1$$

| 1 | 1 | 1              |
_Table 2.1: Truth table for an AND gate._

#### OR-Gate

The OR logic gate uses '+' operator, to create a _1-prioritized_ output.

Drawing parallel to the decimal system, the '+'-operator could be seen as an addition-style operator, where any singular input has to =1 in order for the output to =1.
$$0 + 0 = 0$$
$$0 + 1 = 1$$
$$1 + 0 = 1$$
$$1 + 1 = 1$$

| 1 | 1 | 1              |
_Table 2.2: Truth table for an OR gate._

#### NOT-Gate

The NOT logic gate doesn't use an operator, but acts as an inverter, giving the **opposite** output to its input.

If a parallel can even be drawn to decimal, it would be to multiply the input by -1, to invert the sign of the input; though this isn't a complete analogy.
$$\overline{1} = 0$$
$$\overline{0} = 1$$

> Let's design a logic circuit to implement the Boolean expression $F = (A \cdot B) + \overline{C}$.
> 
> **Step 1: Analyze the expression.** The expression has two main operations combined by an OR (+): $(A \cdot B)$ and $\overline{C}$. This means the final output will come from an OR gate.
> 
> **Step 2: Identify the inputs to the final gate.** The inputs to the OR gate are the results of $(A \cdot B)$ and $\overline{C}$.
> 
> **Step 3: Design the sub-circuits.**
> - The term $(A \cdot B)$ is an AND operation, so we need an AND gate with inputs A and B.
> - The term $\overline{C}$ is a NOT operation, so we need a NOT gate with input C.
> 
> **Step 4: Combine the components.** The outputs of the AND gate and the NOT gate become the inputs to the final OR gate. The output of the OR gate is the final output, F.
